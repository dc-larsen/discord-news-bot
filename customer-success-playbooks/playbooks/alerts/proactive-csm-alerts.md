# Proactive CSM Alerts Playbook

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
CSM alerts help teams stay tightly aligned with their book of business and allow proactive customer engagement without having to constantly pull reports manually.

## ðŸš¨ Alert Types

### Expansion Opportunities

1. **High license usage approaching**
   - **Trigger:** Customer is close to using 90â€“95% of their seats
   - **Purpose:** Get ahead of expansion conversations before it's too late

2. **License usage hits 100%**
   - **Trigger:** Customer hits full seat usage
   - **Purpose:** Immediate trigger for expansion conversation

### Churn Risk Indicators

3. **Product usage trending down**
   - **Trigger:** Significant drop in usage (e.g., customer once used 15/15 seats but now uses 3/15)
   - **Purpose:** Identify churn risk early and investigate the cause (e.g., champion departure, feature adoption issues)

4. **No recent activity**
   - **Trigger:** Customer hasn't logged in or used their workspace in 14 days
   - **Purpose:** Identify disengagement early and prompt a check-in

5. **Key integration removed**
   - **Trigger:** Connected integration (e.g., Jira, Slack, or another relevant system) is removed or disconnected
   - **Purpose:** Detect potential workflow disruptions and address gaps that could impact product value

### Account Management

6. **New customer or expansion closed**
   - **Trigger:** New customer is signed or an expansion happens
   - **Purpose:** Celebrate wins. Keep CSMs in the loop and build team momentum

7. **Risk updates**
   - **Trigger:** Risk field is updated on an account (e.g., "at risk")
   - **Purpose:** Allow immediate collaboration and intervention before escalation

8. **Onboarding completion**
   - **Trigger:** Onboarding is marked complete
   - **Purpose:** Keep CSMs aware of lifecycle milestones and give an opportunity for post-onboarding engagement

### Safety Net Alerts

9. **Customer call gap**
   - **Trigger:** No customer call has been logged in 90 days
   - **Purpose:** Safety net to prevent accounts from drifting

10. **Renewal countdown timers**
    - **Trigger:** Alerts at 90, 30, 14, and 7 days before renewal, plus a "renewal overdue" alert
    - **Purpose:** Prioritize renewal outreach and improve forecasting

11. **Open product issues**
    - **Trigger:** Product issue is reported by you (or another CSM) or tagged to one of your accounts
    - **Purpose:** Keep customer-reported issues visible until resolved

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

**This could be built via:**
- Internal automations (Dock, Gainsight, etc.)
- HubSpot/Salesforce/Zapier integrations
- Lightweight custom solution

**Goal is to make it easy for every CSM to have a running pulse on their accounts without manual report pulls.**

## ðŸ“‹ Best Practices

- Set up alerts that matter most to your business model and customer lifecycle
- Test alert thresholds to avoid notification fatigue
- Ensure alerts route to the right CSM or team
- Review and adjust alert criteria quarterly based on effectiveness
- Use alerts as triggers for immediate action, not just information
