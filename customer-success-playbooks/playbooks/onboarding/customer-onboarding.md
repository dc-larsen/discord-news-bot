# Customer Onboarding Playbook

## üéØ Purpose
A new customer is like starting a new relationship. You get a chance to start over, so don't mess it up.

## üìã Pre-Meeting Prep

### Research Their Business
**Before you talk to the customer:**
- **Check their jobs page.** What roles are they hiring for, and how does that impact you and your product?
- If you have a technical product, **check what programming languages they're hiring for.** Does your product support them?
- **Job descriptions contain a ton of intel** ‚Äî get used to parsing them before an intro call

### Check Your CRM
**Check HubSpot or Salesforce:**
- Who are the contacts? Who signed the order form?
- Did sales document why they bought the solution?
- Gather any other relevant CRM details

### Sync with Sales
- **Set up a quick 15-minute sync on the new account**
- **Ask: What went well during the POV? What's still open or pending from us?**

## üìû First Customer Call

### Focus on Problems, Not Product
- **Keep the first 15 minutes completely void of product talk**
- **Focus on getting to know them, the problem they have, and what they care about**

### Understand Their Real Problems
- **Remember: their problem wasn't "we didn't have your tool"**
  - Examples: vulnerabilities weren't found until production; app was getting negative performance reviews
- **If you don't leave the call knowing their problems, you failed**

## üß† Consultative Mode

### After you understand their problems, move into consultative mode:
- **How can the product they just bought help or fix those problems?**
- **What features are essential? Which are optional?**
- **What has made other customers with the same problems successful?**

### Document Everything
- **Document the problems they want to solve somewhere** (preferably in Salesforce or HubSpot)

## üìß Post-Call Actions

### Immediate Follow-Up
- **Send an AI-generated summary of the call and next steps** via email or Slack

## üìù Mutual Success Plan

### Create a Success Plan That:
- **Captures their problem in bold at the top**
- **Lists the steps you'll take to help solve it**
- **Ties every step back to the problem**
- Example: product features to adopt (SSO setup, configuring alerts, etc.)
- **Link this plan in your CRM**

## üèÅ Closing Out Onboarding

### Define Clear Completion Criteria
**Onboarding must have an end:**
- **It cannot last forever** ‚Äî there must be a measurable completion point
- **Define criteria** such as time to first value, time to deployment, or another metric
- **You need a clear point to say: "We have successfully onboarded this customer"**

### Why This Matters
**Poor onboarding is one of the top reasons customers churn later.**

*Get the relationship right from day one. Their success starts with understanding their real problems, not showcasing your features.*
