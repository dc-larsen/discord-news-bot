# Regular Cadence Meetings with Customers

## üéØ Purpose
I have been on both sides of this and it can be painful if not done right. This playbook ensures your regular customer meetings drive value, surface insights, and protect your book of business.

## üìã Pre-Meeting Preparation

### Set the Agenda
- **The vendor sets the agenda for the meeting**
- **Send it ahead of time** ‚Äî either the morning of or the day before
- Come prepared with status updates including:
  - Open support tickets
  - Feature requests  
  - Any action items from the last meeting

### Automate What You Can
- **Find a way to automate the support tickets and feature requests portion for yourself**
- Use your tools to pull this data automatically rather than manually compiling

### Review Customer Data
**Look at the customer's data before the meeting.** Log in to their SaaS instance and see what they've been doing:

- What vulnerabilities did we find?
- What errors did we find?  
- Whatever your product does‚Ä¶ is there anything new or interesting to discuss?

**If nothing new is found, that's a problem.** Either they are not using your product or it's not working.

## üéôÔ∏è Running the Meeting

### Record Everything
- **The meeting should be recorded in Gong** (or your recording tool)
- **Use AI meeting notes to minimize effort**

### Drive with Product Insights
**A good CSM or Customer Engineer leverages product insights to drive next steps:**

- If a critical vulnerability was found, the conversation should be all about how to get it fixed
- **Ask: What workflows exist to get it updated or fixed?**

### Be a Solution Finder
- **Don't say "we can't do this"** ‚Äî instead, explain how you or other customers face the same challenge and solve for it

### Assign Action Items
- **Give customers action items and expect that some won't be completed**
- Find out how engaged they are
- Work with them: maybe walk them through it live on the call or do it for them if they provide needed info (e.g., setting up SSO)

### Document Risks
**Document any risks discussed in your CRM** (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.):
- Tool consolidation talk
- Champion leaving
- New director from a competitor  
- Anything else that could affect renewal or product adoption

**Your role includes being an information gatherer** ‚Äî risk documentation is key for accurate forecasting.

## üìß Post-Meeting Actions

### Follow-Up Every Time
- **After the meeting, send the customer a follow-up email** (or Slack message if you share a channel) **EVERY time**

### Complete the Engagement
**Engagement is not over until:**
1. **You send that email**
2. **You open any support tickets or feature requests that came from the call**

## ‚è∞ Knowing When to Step Back

### Reduce Meeting Frequency
- **If the customer is happy and your product is solving their problems, reduce meeting frequency**
- Keep quarterly check-ins depending on your book of business
- **Protect your time so you can help other customers**
