# Case Studies Playbook

## 🎯 Purpose
To define when and how a CSM should initiate, prepare for, and execute a customer case study, in alignment with the customer lifecycle and other CS processes (onboarding, cadence meetings, alerts).

## ✅ Case Study Readiness Criteria

Before pursuing any case study, verify:

- **Mutual Success Plan milestones have been met**
- **Measurable KPI improvement has occurred** (e.g., performance, productivity, security posture)
- **Positive sentiment is expressed by the customer** (NPS ≥ 8, unsolicited praise, or confirmed renewal)
- **The product is demonstrably solving the customer's core problem** — if no real problem is solved, no case study should be pursued
- **Avoid customers with MSA restrictions** that block public logo/name use, unless doing an anonymized industry-focused case study (e.g., "a major airline")

## 🤝 Internal Alignment Before Asking

**Complete these steps before approaching the customer:**

- **CSM and marketing agree on the narrative angle** (technical win, ROI, speed of deployment, competitive replacement, etc.)
- **Loop in sales** if there is expansion or renewal influence
- **Confirm with legal** that there are no contractual blockers

## 🔍 Customer Approval Path

**Map the approval process:**

- **Identify the approvals needed at the customer** (marketing, legal, executive sponsor)
- **Map out the process** so the internal champion knows what's required before committing

## 📊 Data Collection

**Gather proof points:**

- **Capture baseline metrics from onboarding** ("before" picture)
- **Capture current metrics showing impact**
- **Document real stories/examples of problems solved**
- **Collect strong customer quotes from past calls** that could be used

## 🎁 Incentives & Value for the Champion

**Make it worth their time:**

- **Professional recognition** — name, title, and photo featured on your site or social channels
- **Give them a polished PDF** they can share internally and on LinkedIn
- **Share metrics post-publication** ("Your story's been read X times") to reinforce their impact
- **Offer optional incentives:** small gifts, gift cards, early access to beta features, or co-marketing exposure
- **Tie the case study's success to the champion's personal KPIs** to position them as a leader internally

## 🔄 Execution Process

**Follow this workflow:**

1. **CSM builds trust and gets verbal commitment** from the champion
2. **Marketing acts as the "reporter,"** interviewing the champion and drafting the story
3. **CSM supports the process** by providing data, customer context, and ensuring accuracy in the story

## 📢 Post-Publication Follow-up

**Complete the loop:**

- **Share the final case study with the champion** in multiple formats (PDF, link)
- **Recognize the customer publicly** (social media, internal comms)
- **Reference the win in future QBRs and cadence calls**
- **Track performance of the case study** and share updates with the champion

## 🔗 Integration with Other Playbooks

**Connect to existing processes:**

- **Onboarding Playbook** → Identify the problem and KPI early
- **Cadence Meeting Playbook** → Track progress toward KPI in every meeting
- **Alerts Playbook** → Trigger a "Case Study Candidate" alert when certain success criteria are met (e.g., KPI improvement ≥ X%)
